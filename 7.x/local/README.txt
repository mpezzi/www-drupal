This contains two sub-directories: common and sites.

Inside sites will be one directory for each site you're running. In our diagram, these are a.com and b.com
Sometimes, if you're not using multisite, you might not have anything in this directory.

Inside common will be directories like "all", "default", and the .htaccess file for the site. You might also 
put some development domain directories (like localhost) so you can use different database connections in 
different environments.
